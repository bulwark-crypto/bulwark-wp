# Introducing Bulwark

## A solid foundation

Every home needs a solid foundation, and Bulwark is no different. Bulwark is built upon \textit{PIVX}, which itself is built upon the popular \textit{DASH} cryptocurrency. While lineages can all be traced back to the original Satoshi Core, each project has chosen a particular direction with goals and ideals that represent the communities they serve. We will extend, and place emphasis on, the privacy coin features of our predecessor platforms by exploring new technologies, while creating tool sets and opportunities for Bulwark's integration into present day technology platforms.

## A team dedicated to the community

For some projects, communities are an afterthought. Bulwark's number one priority is the community. With giveaways, contests, a lively discussion platform and a zero-tolerance policy toward the harassment of newcomers, Bulwark strives to be the cryptocurrency for all varieties of end-users. Members of our userbase are already contributing useful scripts and guides to further enhance the user experience.

## Fair and balanced

At the time of writing, there have been an influx of cryptocurrencies utilizing a similar foundation. While the underlying technology is solid, oftentimes a deeper examination of their specifications and blockchain parameters reveals less-than-fair practices.

## Fast and functional

With a 90 second block time, masternode consensus and transaction locking, reasonable emissions schedule, and eco-friendly staking, Bulwark aspires to be a truly fast and functional cryptocurrency.

## Privacy Hardware Development 

Bulwark has elected to put its primary focus on developing a number of privacy hardware developments to enhance a user's abilities to retain their freedom and privacy while providing a justifiable price point. Some of these developments are discussed more in depth in Chapter 7 (The Future) and include staking boxes, secure local masternode hosting solutions, hardware wallets, and network routers.
