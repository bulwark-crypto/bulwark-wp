# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

Bulwark (ticker: BWK) is a community-oriented coin born out of an observation of generally unfair practices within the masternode privacy coin space. Our deliberate, fair, launch strategy allows participants the opportunity to join a promising project at inception. We offer a simple value proposition with no grandiose promise: we will deliver a privacy coin that works today and into the future by leveraging best-practices from both DASH and PIVX. No fanciful visions with a limited prospect of delivery, but a working coin on a working platform with support into the future. This does not mean we plan no innovation, but instead that we will deliver results rather than hype. Bulwark's main focus will be on a number of privacy hardware developments that will expand upon the capabilities of our blockchain while also offering additional privacy enhancements for those that choose to build or acquire them. With no ICO, a soft-launch reward ramp, small premine, and miner-favored block reward allocations, Bulwark adopters will have ground-floor access to a privacy coin offering a blend of masternodes and the best available privacy hardware technology alongside a meaningful development roadmap. Masternodes will be available, and functioning, on launch and are a fundamental part of this coin's vision and will stabilize circulation, secure the network, and provide important functionality.
